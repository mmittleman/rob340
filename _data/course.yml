description: |
  his advanced course covers fundamentals of Design for Human-Robot Interaction, leading to the creation of memorable relationships with robots. Topics include Frameworks for Robot Design; ideation strategies for robotics such as body-storming and speculation; participatory design with end-users and communities; creation of mock-ups and prototypes to test ideas; development of qualitative and quantitative key-performance indicators to measure the success of the robot; design for ethics, equality, and justice in robotics. We will create a vision for relationships between humans and robots that are inspiring, refined, and magical. This course will prepare you to be a full-stack interaction robot designer.
